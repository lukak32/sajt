<h1 id="header">How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>

<a href="http://www.time.com" id="alarm" target="_blank"><img src="slike/alarm.jpg" width="100" height="200" " alt="alarm"></a>

<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

<p>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
applies even more to the online world, than in regular
business.</p>

<p>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

<p>And since cash <span class="dfg">isn't really a barrier</span>, time-management has
become all the more critical. <span class="zxc">Your challenge for success</span> is
simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

<p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
you do to avoid them?</p>

<ol start="15">
<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
<li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
<li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h2>
------------------------------------------------


<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
having to type the same thing twice.</p>

<p>I use this utility <a href="http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target="_blank" title="Programme time pilot">typepilot</a> , but
there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
available.</p>

<h3>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h3>
-----------------------------------------

<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
own installed on your computer.</p>
<div id="asd">
<p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
through them afterwards and pull back any that have
been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

<p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.</p>
