		<p>Predmet proučavanja istorije čine događaji iz prošlosti koji se odnose na čoveka kao na društveno biće. Mnogi događaji iz prošlosti nisu predmet proučavanja istorije (istorija Sunčevog sistema, istorija Zemljine kore itd).</p>
		<p>The near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help, but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The dollar-sign ("$") was not so useful in England, and the accented characters used in Spanish, French, German, and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals, companies, and countries defined extra characters as needed—often reassigning control characters, or using value in the range from 128 to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the most common way of explicitly stating the specific encoding of plain text is with a MIME type. For email and http, the default MIME type is "text/plain" -- plain text without markup. Another MIME type often used in both email and http is "text/html; charset=UTF-8" -- plain text represented using UTF-8 character encoding with HTML markup. Another common MIME type is "application/json" -- plain text represented using UTF-8 character encoding with JSON markup.</p>
